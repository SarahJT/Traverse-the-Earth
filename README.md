# Traverse the Earth
Hi, my name is Sarah Thiemann and this readme is about my travels with my husband, Roger and how I believe thre is practical application for many people.

I thought Traverse the Earth was a good name and since in code we traverse the DOM, incorporating 'Travers' was applicable syntax!  

Home: A high level look at our site with two active links to our travels dived by East and West. An active Nav bar to take you anywhere on the site using a JS dropdown button that traverses deeper into the sight.  

About Us: is a short synopsis of what we have accomplished in twelve years.

Contact US: this site will have a responsive form where we can be contacted for advise and positive/negative
feedback of our experiences

Western Hemisphere & Eastern Hemisphere: Both these pages will chronical the places, major for now. In the future is will include asides we have experienced. This will be through a POPUP Modal so the viewer will be able to read a short description and view and enlarged version of the picture on the page.

Tips: a page for our pre trip planning and post trip organization for the pictures and items that came home with you!

Future Plans:  a page with a responsive form, so if anyone viewing the site has been somewhere before us they are able to provide a do's and don't page.

In the past twelve years we have managed to travel by car and air around the United States...what an awesome country we live in.  We have also managed to see parts of Europe and Central America, Canada (East and West).
We are not high end travelers but we mange a splurge every now and then.  This is where I thought a site for people who work, and who want some insight to practical application for vacations.  It is a no bones approach to travel and what hard earned money can buy.

I am currently working on the Eastern and Western pages for the popup modals and the responsive forms.

Thanks for viewing and happy traversing!

Sarah
