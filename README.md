# Traverse the Earth
Hi, my name is Sarah Thiemann and this read me is about my travels with my husband, Roger.

Deciding what topic to create a site on was hard for me because I like "everything".
But twelve years ago I met a person who loves adventure almost as much as I do.  
I spent much of my earlier adult life as a single parent to four daughters so going places was limited to camping trips in Michigan(we had fun and we still go there!).  

When Roger and I met we decided to go on a trip...it was a biggie for me, outside the country to Jamaica.   
I was so excited to finally "own" a passport I could hardly believe it was true.
This site is about the excitement and fun Roger and I have had planning and going on trips.

I thought Traverse the Earth was a good name and since in code we traverse the DOM, incorporating 'Travers' was applicable syntax!

In the past twelve years we have managed to travel by car and air around the United States...what an awesome country we live in.  We have also managed to see parts of Europe and Central America, Canada (East and West).
We are not high end travelers but we mange a splurge every now and then.  This is where I thought a site for people who work,  and who want some insight to practical application for vacations and what their hard earned money might get them.

I am currently working on the Eastern and Western pages and popup modals...a work in progress and long as we can travel!
